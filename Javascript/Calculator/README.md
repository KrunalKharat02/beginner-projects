Completed On: 28 January 2016  
Last Updated: 30 March 2017

## Objectives

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

**Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

## User Stories

- I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
